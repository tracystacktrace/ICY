Briefcase update! Updated some branding elements, including big logo!

**Internal changes:**
- Added a separate, a little bit advanced caching for this mod
- Internal GUI code changes, the mod now uses [HelloGUI](https://github.com/tracystacktrace/HelloGUI) for dynamic config GUIs
- Added a nicer and more advanced API for this mod. I can easily add my own additional description for specific items, so you do
- Deleted an old event "based" description collector. Use other method provided in readme.md

  - Pistons (both standard and sticky)
